Training-the-model
This project will help to understand the basics of NLP. The main goal of  this project is to understand the different methods used in measuring the similarity of a given text data. 
The need to compute teh similarity between texts arises due to:-
1) Search Engines:- need to model the relevance of a document to a query, beyond the overlap in words between the two. For instance, question-and-answer sites such as Quora or Stackoverflow need to determine whether a question has already been asked before.
2) In legal matters, text similarity task allow to mitigate risks on a new contract, based on the assumption that if a new contract is similar to a existent one that has been proved to be resilient, the risk of this new contract being the cause of financial loss is minimised. Here is the principle of Case Law principle. Automatic linking of related documents ensures that identical situations are treated similarly in every case. Text similarity foster fairness and equality. Precedence retrieval of legal documents is an information retrieval task to retrieve prior case documents that are related to a given case document.
